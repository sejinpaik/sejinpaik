- 👋 * Hi, I’m @sejinpaik
- 👀 * I research journalism HCI. What does that mean? It's about understanding how the journalism ecology (creators, content, consumers) interacts with AI and digital systems. I am also interested in the ethics of AI, media, and technology. I care deeply about creating a healthier and more soul-ful digital information consumption environment.
- 🌱 * Highkey obsessed with TikTok videos, Late Night, Keeping up w the Kardashians (now deprecated), contemporary art & art history, extra boba and four-legged, fur-ball friends.
