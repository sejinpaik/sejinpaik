- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sejinpaik
- ğŸ‘€ I research journalism HCI. What does that mean? It's about understanding how the journalism ecology (creators, content, consumers) interacts with AI and digital systems. I am also interested in the ethics of AI, media, and technology. I care deeply about creating a healtheir and more soul-ful digital information consumption environment.
- ğŸŒ± Highkey obsessed with TikTok videos, Late Night, Keeping up w the Kardashians (now deprecated), and four-legged, fur-ball friends. (I am, a media researcher, after all ;))
